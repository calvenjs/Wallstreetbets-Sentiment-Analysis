"U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, and Congressional Budget Office release reports proving the economy has taken massive downturn Q2, and admits inflation and GDP growth will surpass ""unsustainable levels"" by the end of the year. 2011 CBO projections v.s. 2021 actual numbers","2011 Congressional Budget Office projections v.s. the actual 2021 Budget numbers for Jan-July 2021 

In August 2011 during the debt ceiling crisis, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that the federal budget would show a deficit of close to $1.5 trillion, or 9.8 percent of GDP. 

That is nearly 1 percentage point higher than the shortfall recorded in 2010 and almost equal to the deficit posted in 2009, which at 10.0 % of GDP was the highest in nearly 65 years at the time. 

As of 8/1/21 we are entering a new debt ceiling crisis with congress on a 6 week vacation, combined with an expired rent moratorium where 6.2 million renters face evictions, the homeowners of said tenant's houses will likely never receive back-pay for rent owed possibly causing record high bankruptcies akin to 2008 or worse, and without taking this into account, CBO projects a federal budget deficit of $3.0 trillion this year as the economic disruption caused by the 2020–2021coronavirus pandemic, while the legislation enacted in response continue to boost the deficit (which was large by historical standards even before the pandemic).  

<I applaud you for making it through the longest sentence in history 👏>

At 13.4 % of gross domestic product (GDP), the deficit in 2021 would be the second largest since 1945, exceeded only by the 14.9 % shortfall recorded in 2020. 

For the period of economic expansion from the second quarter of 2009 through the fourth quarter of 2019, real GDP increased at an annual rate of 2.3 %.

For the period of economic expansion from the second quarter of 2020 through the first quarter of 2021, real GDP increased at an annual rate of 14.1 % which in my opinion and as shown below by these reports is due to the insanely high level of newly printed money and covid stimulus payments. 

https://www.cbo.gov/publication/21999

However the CBO estimates from 2011 would be heaven compared to the reality we're facing, which is a crippled economy and stock market on the verge of collapse. Evidence below; 

In 2011 CBO projected the 3 month Treasury bill to be worth 4.4% in 2021. 

The actual 3 month Treasury bill rate for July 2021 is worth between 0.01 and 0.06%.

In 2011 the projected 10 year Treasury note bill rate was projected to be 5.4% for 2021

The actual 10 year Treasury note bill rate is 1.24% In July 2021

7/29/2021 Report Released by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Beureau of Economic Analysis, on the Gross Domestic Product, Second Quarter 2021

Personal Income

A report by the Beureau of Economic Analysis, BEA, shows that the 2nd quarter of 2021 has been a bloodbath in terms of loss of income, savings, and increased expenses for the average American. 

""Current-dollar personal income decreased $1.32 trillion in the second quarter, or 22.0 percent, in contrast to an increase of $2.33 trillion (revised), or 56.8 percent, in the first quarter of 2021.""

This means that income literally was cut by nearly 22% on average in 2nd quarter of 2021. 

Disposable personal income decreased $1.42 trillion, or 26.1 percent, in the second quarter, in contrast to an increase of $2.27 trillion, or 63.7 percent (revised), in the first quarter. 

Real disposable personal income decreased 30.6 percent in Q2, in contrast to an increase of 57.6 percent in Q1.

This means that (money considered as non-essential to bills, insert eye roll here) decreased by over $890 billion for Americans. 

Personal outlays increased $680.8 billion in Q2, after increasing $538.8 billion for Q1. 

This means that expenses have increased by $150+ Billion in average from Q1 2021 to Q2 2021. 

Personal saving was $1.97 trillion in the second quarter, compared with $4.07 trillion (revised) in the first quarter.  

The personal saving rate—personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income—was down to 10.9 percent in the second quarter, compared with 20.8 percent in the first quarter.

This means Americans have lost $3 TRILLION in savings Q2 2021 vs Q1 2021. That's a 10 percent decrease in savings in Q2 2021. 

Inflation seems to be the only thing that's going up this quarter and it's doubled. 

""The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 5.7 percent in the second quarter, compared with an increase of 3.9 percent (revised) in the first quarter...
 
The PCE price index increased 6.4 percent, compared with an increase of 3.8 percent in the 1st quarter. 

Excluding food and energy prices, the PCE price index increased 6.1 percent (in Q2), compared with an increase of 2.7 percent in Q1 2021""

Report Released by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, on GDP and the Economy for
Q1 2021

GDP by Expenditure

The acceleration in real GDP growth in the first quarter reflected artificial economic strength.

The GDP is primarily based in the continued economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as government assistance payments were distributed to households and businesses. An acceleration in consumer spending and upturns in federal as well as state and local government spending more than accounted for the acceleration in real GDP. 

These were partly offset by downturns in private inventory investment and exports and by decelerations in residential fixed investment and nonresidential fixed investment. Imports slowed.

The Truth of the US Economy by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis;

The acceleration in consumer spending reflected an upturn in spending on goods and an acceleration in spending on services.

Within goods, all components of both durable and nondurable goods contributed to the upturn. The leading contributors were upturns in spending on motor vehicles and parts as well as on food and beverages purchased for off-premises consumption.

Within services, the leading contributors to the acceleration were upturns in spending on food services and accommodations and on transportation services.

An upturn in federal government spending was the second largest contributor to the acceleration in real GDP. The upturn primarily reflected an upturn in nondefense spending on intermediate goods and services purchased by government. In the first quarter, the processing and administration of Paycheck Protection Program loan applications by banks on behalf of the federal government added approximately $13.2 billion ($52.6 billion at an annual rate) to nondefense services. Federal government purchases of COVID-19 vaccines for distribution to the public contributed to the upturn in nondefense goods.

The upturn in state and local government spending reflected an upturn in consumption expenditures, led by compensation of employees, that was partly offset by a downturn in gross investment, led by a downturn in structures.

The downturn in private inventory investment was led by a larger decrease in retail trade and a downturn in manufacturing. Within retail trade, the largest contributor was a larger decrease in inventory investment by motor vehicle dealers. Within manufacturing, there were downturns in both durable and nondurable goods manufacturing inventory investment.

The downturn in exports reflected downturns in both goods (led by a deceleration in industrial supplies and a downturn in foods, feeds, and beverages) and services (led by a deceleration in transport and a downturn in royalties and license fees).

Residential fixed investment slowed, largely reflecting a slowdown in new residential structures, notably single-family units, and a downturn in brokers' commissions.

Nonresidential fixed investment slowed, reflecting a slowdown in investment in equipment that was partly offset by a smaller decrease in investment in structures. Investment in intellectual property products grew at about the same rate as in the fourth quarter.

The slowdown in equipment investment was more than accounted for by a slowdown in transportation equipment that was partly offset by an acceleration in information processing equipment.

The smaller decrease in structures was more than accounted for by a smaller decrease in investment in industrial structures.

Imports slowed. As a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, imports contributed to the acceleration in first-quarter GDP. The main contributor was a downturn in automotive vehicles, engines, and parts

July 21, 2021 
CBO released report: ""Additional Information About the Updated Budget and Economic Outlook: 2021 to 2031""

""As the pandemic eases and demand for consumer services surges, real (inflation-adjusted) GDP in CBO’s projections grows by 7.4 percent this year and surpasses its potential (maximum sustainable) level by the end of the year."" -direct quote. 

A.K.A a market crash is insinuated by CBO and they directly state that the GDP of this nation surpassing maximum sustainability!!!

The Debt Ceiling Dillema 

""A two-year deal to suspend the debt ceiling lapsed at midnight (7/31/21) following inaction from Congress and President Biden to give the U.S. more borrowing authority. The Treasury Department will now begin taking what it refers to as ""extraordinary measures"" to prevent the U.S. from defaulting on its debt.""

""Republican leaders have told Democrats that there can be no bipartisan debt ceiling agreement without a slate of debt reduction measures targeting the roughly $28 trillion national debt. Several GOP lawmakers have floated a deal similar to the 2011 Budget Control Act, which ended a debt ceiling standoff shortly before the U.S. suffered its first ever credit downgrade.""

CBO says, ""the Treasury would probably run out of cash sometime in the first quarter of the next fiscal year (which begins on October 1, 2021, most likely in October or November, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. If that occurred, the government would be unable to pay its obligations fully, and it would delay making payments for its activities, default on its debt obligations, or both.

The timing and size of revenue collections and outlays over the coming months could differ noticeably from CBO's projections. 
Therefore, the extraordinary measures could be exhausted, and the Treasury could run out of cash, either earlier or later than CBO projects.

Yellen has also said uncertainty driven by the coronavirus pandemic and the federal government's fiscal response has made it harder to pin down exactly how long the U.S. to avoid a default.""

Yellen stated that the default could happen as soon as early September. 

This means we could see the US Treasury's ability to pay almost all bills completely crippled well before Congress' return to duty as they just began a 6 week vacation on 7/31/21.

https://thehill.com/policy/finance/565745-missed-debt-ceiling-deadline-kicks-off-high-stakes-fight

Our GDP is a complete farce that was being held up by stimulus payments, government covid spending, Repurchase/Reverse Repurchase Agreements of Treasury Bills to the tune of now over $1 Trillion per day, imports and exports are down huge while sea ports are more severely congested than ever before as are airline cargo carriers. Mortgage applications, sales, and broker commissions are down heavily, trucking rates are at all time highs with minimal availability especially for ocean and rail drayage, warehouse storage for said freight is at all time lows with prices at all time highs due to supply and demand, retail trade and manufacturing are down significantly as well in Q2.  Consumer spending is down as well as savings to lows not seen in many years as well

Essentially the bubble from stimulus has already been popped.  It's only a short matter of time before we see the effects on our country.

A 2015 report from the Government Accountability Office analyzing the 2013 debt ceiling standoff found that ""investors reported taking the unprecedented action of systematically avoiding certain Treasury securities,"" which are considered almost as safe as cash, causing widespread issues across credit markets.

""Industry groups emphasized that even a temporary delay in payment could undermine confidence in the full faith and credit of the United States and therefore cause significant damage to markets for Treasury securities and other assets,"" the report said.

The last 2 times the debt ceiling crisis occurred in 2011 and 2013, rating agencies to re-evaluate the rating of US government debt.

On October 15 2013, Fitch Ratings placed the United States under a ""Rating watch negative"" in response to the crisis. 

On October 17 2013, Dagong Global Credit Rating downgraded the United States from A to A−, and maintained a negative outlook on the country's credit.

In 2013 while lawmakers and the Obama Administration came to an agreement on the debt ceiling, from September 19th to October 9th, the S&P 500 moved below its 50 day moving average and the SPY lost 5.2%.

On 8/9/2011 during the Debt Ceiling Crisis
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 634.76 points as approximately $2.5 TRILLION was erased from global equities.

That's $2,500,000,000,000.00 in one day. 

The S&P 500 Index lost 6.7 per cent to 1,119.46, its lowest level since September, as all 500 stocks fell for the first time since Bloomberg began tracking the data in 1996.

Once In A Lifetime Hog Future Opportunity In California,"As the beginning of next year, California will enforce new animal welfare law for breeding pigs and other farm animals. But only 4% of the hog operations currently can comply. According to one farmer, to meet the new standard, he needs 3 million for the upgrade to raise just 250 hogs. Restaurants owners are worried because bacon is one of the most popular breakfast items and bacon helped their business survive the pandemic. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-31/bacon-may-disappear-in-california-as-pig-rules-take-effect](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-31/bacon-may-disappear-in-california-as-pig-rules-take-effect?srnd=premium)).  People love bacon from all backgrounds. ""You know, I work and live with a lot of Asian and Hispanic populations in the city and their diet consists of pork bacon. Pork bacon is huge,"" Kim said. ""It’s almost like bread and butter.""

Bacon love is ingrained into our soul and genetics and therefore an inelastic demand. A small change in bacon supply can lead to a drastic change in price, as explained by graph below.

[Inelastic Demand Price Action](https://preview.redd.it/huc5pz6xoue71.jpg?width=570&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fcea15c61d5e19157c1cfb07d1e9684142bf67c2)

According to consulting firm Hitamiya Group, if half of the pork supply was lost, bacon price would jump 60% which means a $6 package could rise to $9.60 cents ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-31/bacon-may-disappear-in-california-as-pig-rules-take-effect?srnd=premium](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-31/bacon-may-disappear-in-california-as-pig-rules-take-effect?srnd=premium)). If 90% - 95% of the supplies are gone, the fair price should be at least 2.5 times the current market value. And that means **1 package of bacon is $15 per package.**

You must wonder, how do I profit from this? A very ancient trade technique - BUY LOW SELL HIGH

I am not talking about buying 10 packs of bacon from Costco and resale them later. I am talking about doing it at scale. Go big or go home.

**Step 1 - Install Freezers in Your Garage**

Let’s figure out how many freezers you can potentially have. First park your cars on the street and empty the garage. The average garage size is 12 feet \* 22 feet \* 8 feet. So 12 \* 22 \* 8 = 2112 cubic feet.

The below fridge dimension is 37.25 x 20.75 x 33.25 inches and can storage up to 7 cubic feet items.

[ Ideal Fridge to Keep Bacon](https://preview.redd.it/yfk3jbp3que71.jpg?width=1282&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=731f5da26e2187ec37b1dbd4fbabc5b7789ebd15)

Let’s do more math to see how many fridges your garage can potentially store.

2112 (volume of garage) \* 1728 (1 cubic feet is 1728 cubic inch) / 37.25 \* 20.75 \* 33.25 (volume of fridge) = **142 fridges**

Obviously you can’t just stack all of those fridges in the garage. Let’s say we can achieve 80% of that. And that means you can have around **110 fridges.**

Remember to use Amazon FREE SHIPPING. Very important to save cost.

**Fridge Cost with Tax**: 110 \* 229 \* 1.1 (Uncle Sam wants the tax) = **$27709**

|**Item**|Cost|
|:-|:-|
|110 Fridges|$27709|

**Step 2 - Buy Bacon in Bulk and use FREE SHIPPING**

According to USDA ([https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/meat-price-spreads/](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/meat-price-spreads/)), one package (1 pound) of bacon in  June 2021 is about $6.67. We can get this much lower by buying from Costco in BULK. As you can see below, **our one package cost is $4.53** AFTER tax including delivery. Again, very important to use free shipping to save cost.

[Bacon Price From Costco](https://preview.redd.it/4a12382erue71.png?width=1840&format=png&auto=webp&s=48f5dacba1eb055847e3b266aef24fb5abcee393)

It's time to calculate how much to buy. The size of one package of bacon is about 10 inch \* 4 inch \* 1 inch so 40 cubic inch. And the volume of our fridge is 7 cubic feet which is 12096 cubic inch. So one fridge can store around 300 packages or pounds of bacon. With 110 fridges, we can store 33000 packages or pounds of bacon. Each pound of bacon is $4.53, so the total cost of bacon is $149,490

Total Cost So Far

|**Item**|Cost|
|:-|:-|
|110 Fridges|$27709|
|33000 packages or 2200 cases of bacon|$149,490|

**Step 3 - Factor In the Electricity Cost**

Running 110 freezers in the garage is apparently very energy consuming and electricity is expensive in California, at about 20 cents / kWh.

The freezer is 150 watts so running 110 freezers for let's say 6 months will cost $14256. You can check my math below:

150 watts \* 6 (month) \* 30 (days) \* 24 (hours) / 1000 = 648 kWh (one fridge running a year energy consumption)

648 kWh \* 0.2 cents / kWh \* 110 = $14256

Total Cost So Far

|**Item**|Cost|
|:-|:-|
|110 Fridges|$27709|
|33000 packages or 2200 cases of bacon|$149,490|
|Electricity|$14256|

Step 4 - Sell High And Take Profits

Don't diamond hand bacon, you are in 2022 and it's time to sell for a profit!

The cost of bacon per package factoring in everything so far is **$5.8.** And we unload each package for $15. So that means each package profit is $9.2.

# The total profit is $9.2 * 33000 = $303,600

If you too lazy to contact customers or answer phone calls yourself, just hire someone for like 20K a month to the work for you. I expect the inventory goes to zero in a month so at the end of the day, you pocket close to $280,000 profits.

And you can figure out the tax part and probably can resell those freezers for half the price.

All in an unnecessarily long format so you have something (else) to complain about today!

Part 6. Romancing the Wood

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 1. The Great Woodening**

Cathie's Ark funds have been around for a while now. I know, I lost money on several of them back before she blew up. Keep this little tidbit in mind as you read on, as there are few things as effective at coloring one's views as the bitterness of missing the boat.

Over the past few years, Cathie blew up on the spot. So much so, that she gave birth to entire youtuber carriers. These guys just put on 'youtube face' for the thumbnail, add a title like 'What Cathie JUST bought!' (always important to all-cap the 'just'), and then they read out information you could've just gotten by signing up for her trade notifications yourself.

So how did this come to be? How did this random lady with a questionable investment fund portfolio get dubbed '**the money tree**' by the Koreans?

Answer: She's a fantastic salesperson with accesses to the **full** range of media in order to execute her pumping strategy. And... she bought Tesla. And then pumped the absolute shit out that motherfucker.

You see, her pumping strategy is ***several orders of magnitude*** better than anything you'll ever see here, because she backs her pumps up with next level YOLOs. In order for one of you ~~retards~~ *distinguished investors* to even approach her level, you need the best DD known to man ***and*** you need to follow that post up with a YOLO post were you bought ***tens of millions*** of dollars worth of the stock. And even then, you'd fall horribly short of what this lady can do.

Does this mean I think she's a scam artist? No. Is she running a game? Aren't we all? But I'll get to that more in Part 6. On to the Charts of Fury!

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 2. A Wooden Albatross**

The greatest decision Cathie Wood ever made was to buy Tesla and pump it harder than any stock has been pumped in the history of pumping. I haven't investigated her past enough to know whether she was captain of the cheerleading squad, but good lord, she *should've been*.

The current state of TSLA:

[Elon's back on track](https://preview.redd.it/tqvmp0b04te71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=f06f3e05363260b81cb9a83a745d708b65236332)

A couple of important points about this chart. First, it's still over that green uptrend line, which is decidedly bullish. Second, it broke out of the orange downtrend line. Again, bullish. The only worry I have is that there is a sideways channel forming. However, this uncertainty should resolve itself by the end of this month (August) at the latest.

&#x200B;

Before shitting all over TSLA, let's first compare it to ARKK:

[Should've just bought TSLA](https://preview.redd.it/8ollr3bn4te71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=b67e0273de08a10972ab8b504df1e24d08001d31)

Here we can see that Cathie is under performing her own major holding. And TSLA is far and away her largest holding (some of the other big ones are down below). She holds TLSA as her number one holding in ARKK, ARKW **and** ARKQ (over 10% in all three). If you wanted to outperform Cathie Wood, all you had to do was just buy TSLA yourself. (The percent difference *down* from the top is nearly the same, however, TSLA is *up* 400% from the same point versus her 150%). Why pay her to do it for you? To be fair, she does have other stuff and it's not all bad. However, I named this section the Wooden Albatross because her position here is so large that **as Tesla goes, Cathie goes**.

Which brings me to the problem with Tesla: ***competition***. Tesla was a great investment. Elon got out front of everyone with EVs, proved the doubters wrong, and has reaped outsized rewards for it. But the competition is coming for him. It might not be this year, or even the next, but Tesla ***is going to bleed***. Mark my words, it is going to happen.

With excellent earnings, Tesla is bringing that stratospheric p/e of over 1,000 in 2020 down to something more '*reasonable*' of \~230 for this year, and by 2022 to \~130. That's great. **However**, in order to keep up, Elon is going to need to keep smashing out of the park again and again and again and again and.... You get the point. One miss and this puppy is going for a ride down blood bath mountain.

Still, the chart says up, and I'm by no means bold enough to call the top on Tesla. Tread carefully, friends.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 3. Back to the Future**

If Cathie is known for anything (other than buying Tesla) it's what I like to call 'Cathie Woodisms.' This is a whole universe of new age buzzwordology such as: innovator, disruptor, AI, machine learning, next-gen, etc. Now, I've pointed and laughed at this shit on a fair number of occasions here on the sub. But I also wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ousepa/the_roaring_2020s_why_the_mother_of_all_crashes/), where I made the case that this shit will underpin what I've dubbed **M.A.Rs** **- the Mother of All Rallies**.

Now, what at first blush looks utterly inconsistent, after the application of contorted logic becomes totally consistent! These buzzwords are, ***for the most part***, bullshit and just slapped on any old thing in order to make the pump sound better. However, there are some cases where I think these appellations are more than just sound bites, but represent something truly new. So let's look at some of Cathie's investments that meet that criteria (at least in my eyes).

First, and probably the best, CRSP:

The CRISPR gene editing tool is most next level shit that exists today. Sure, the present applications are limited and for the foreseeable future this will be constrained to dealing with genetic disorders (which should bring hope to you all). The potential of this, however, is truly mind bending. You could no longer be a manlet, for example. You could no longer have to suffer having a woman laugh at you when she sees how small your penis is and ask, ""Is that *really* it? I guess I get to sleep through this session..."" I get to have my 20-year-old hairline back. ***Possibilities***.

If this leads where I'm thinking it leads, then we are in for borderline miracles here, people. Now, just because *this* company has CRISPR in the name, does not mean it will end up being the Chosen One. But for now, let's just say it is. If you're looking for an entry, this is kinda, sorta settling into a channel and is at the bottom of that. If you're a ***believer***, TA doesn't matter; buy it at any price. I regret not picking it up at that dip under a $100.

&#x200B;

Next up, the embodiment of evil, PLTR:

[The Eye of Darkness sees .... a 'maybe' uptrend](https://preview.redd.it/2r1mpc21bte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab25127dfa2315936f5ab4a26f72266bfdf0c06d)

Palantir is difficult to wrap your mind around, but basically they do AI shit, specifically data analytics. While this seems ho-hum, I'm told that it is in fact the precursor to ushering in Big Brother and giving **all the power** to our Totalitarian Corporate Globalist Overlords. Which both gives me a hard on and makes me want to buy the stock. I mean who wants to be on the team with the tiny little hobbits when you can be on the team with the hundred-story high flaming eyeball? Have you guys seen how the Globalist Overlords live? I have it on good authority its just like the rich asshole bad guys in every Gundam series. Man that looks awesome.

As for the chart, it's finding its way into a channel, but there's also support trend line underneath us right now. I think it's a buy at these prices, personally. Though I haven't actually bought it, so you know.... Like CRSP, I think Cathie is right on this one and it's a good ***long*** hold.

&#x200B;

Now let's look at something Cathie was absolutely fucking ***wrong*** on, WKHS:

[Dead-ish Horse](https://preview.redd.it/dgcoewescte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cade3c1428ee8da90fa816f527f849d258d69e9)

This is my third time talking shit about this ticker so I'll keep it brief: **I don't like it**. Nothing they do impresses me. The problem is that anything they do, someone else does better. Drones? Amazon. EVs? Tesla. They are so unimpressive that even Cathie bailed on them, as she no longer holds any shares of this amazing buyout opportunity of a company.

From the chart, again I'm seeing a potential channel forming, which is *amazing* news for the bagholders.

&#x200B;

Next, and because I'm a whore for karma, HOOD:

[What TA!](https://preview.redd.it/4apb6z1udte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=3694002b6d5912eaa9ec3710f3d81a707c0d3cce)

Okay, this is basically a joke chart. Doing TA on a ticker two days on the market is like deciding to marry that kinda chubby girl on your second date because she promised she was working real hard to slim down. And now you have special van to carry her around and can't own a house with more than one story. I'd say more about HOOD, but I don't want to incur the wrath of the **Titans of Wall Street**.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 4. Hardwood Flooring**

Under girding Cathie's ~~degenerate gambling~~ *wise, forward thinking investments* are some pretty solid companies. Indeed, there are too many to cover here, but to give you an idea: **she owns John Deere in her space fund ARKX**. (And her robotics fund, though it makes more sense there as Deere is likely moving toward self-driving tillage equipment). She also owns all kinds of other 'boomer' stuff (e.g., GOOG, AMZN, etc.), so I'm going to limit this part to the other three of her top holdings in ARKK after TSLA.

&#x200B;

First, the second major holding, TDOC:

[That whole re-opening thing in chart form](https://preview.redd.it/k0hfqxe5gte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c6edb9ddba318a1bc93e07bd59390d47db906e6)

So this tele-medicine company has performed as expected after the lockdowns ended: *poorly*. In addition to ARKK (2nd largest position), she owns this in ARKW (#3), ARKG (#1, to be expected), and ARKF (#15). She sure likes this stock. I don't know all the much about it, but its recent under performance is certainly dragging her down given its position among her family of funds.

From the chart, we have a pretty clear downtrend channel. The sliver of hope would be the support line I drew, but it's way too early to call the bottom here. I'll not be buying this at these prices (or ever, if I'm being honest).

&#x200B;

Next, something people around here actually know about, ROKU:

[Nice chart, 9\/10, would fuck](https://preview.redd.it/hcm8mebchte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=040eddc1c05adcbf6e258154597e8fdb1b7c8712)

I'm seething with regret that I passed on this ticker ***several times*** back in 2019. Cathie's not, though. This is one of her better performers, if not the best given it's #3 position in ARKK. I still don't like the company because I don't see how they're going to beat out Amazon, Netflix, etc. But given how horribly wrong I've been thus far, you should definitely not listen to me.

But if you wanted to listen to the chart, you'd wait for a retrace to the uptrend line. The ticker might not give you that, though. With that double top, however, I think more likely than not, *it will*.

&#x200B;

Lastly, some fin-tech magic, SQ:

[The definition of showing up after the party's over](https://preview.redd.it/iedoxkj1ite71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=71bbc455f0b4d93df3d14b88b4651fe4a2d6f606)

I never even heard of this until it was way too fucking late to buy it, so again Captain Sour Grapes has little good to say about it. I do understand what they do, because my nephew works at a restaurant that uses their app for payments. There are others in this space, but the chart says people like Square's chances and I'm not going to argue with that.

On the other hand, we're clearly out of the channel and there is no hope of recovering **that** channel. In keeping with Cbass's top notch TA skills, I eyeballed a rough sideways channel, but just going straight the fuck up from here is just as likely. (Probably in a new parallel channel). Still, this has the shape and feel of a typical big-tech chart: run up, pause for hot sideways action, then resume the run up. I'll not be buying it, I think, but y'all have fun with it anyway.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 5. Cathie & the Chairman**

Cathie's been in the news lately for dumping her Chinese positions. She's certainly not alone in this and if you take the general pulse of investors vis-a-vis China it's.... let's just say ***not good***. I'm going to constrain myself to just her positions, rather than pile on this orgy of 'go fuck yourself.'

First off, she's fully out of Tencent (she dumped the last on Friday, but it's not yet reflected in the holding lists on her website). I won't show the chart because this ticker is on OTC, so I think that's a no-no 'round these parts. There's some other shit she's selling too, but ~~nobody's ever~~ *I've* *never* heard of it.

One of her larger positions that she's still unloading is JD:

[Maybe Xi destroys you, maybe he doesn't... it depends on how his breakfast was](https://preview.redd.it/imq7835hlte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=426c7630ae777261d97a8f37ef08a575b67520c5)

JD is an online sales company like Alibaba or Amazon. It's #2 in China, I believe. I haven't heard any bad news specific to this company, but the general crackdown has hit the whole sector, no exceptions. The chart gives you a maybe-channel to work with if you've got the testicular fortitude for this kind of gambling. It is $10/share back to the top of that channel.... Or a complete breakdown a couple weeks from now when news breaks that the entire board of directors got sent to a gulag.

&#x200B;

I haven't seen any news of her unloading the magic carpet, BABA:

[This looks FINE! \(Weekly candles\)](https://preview.redd.it/qehlylrcmte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=20b50a35e7cb5bcf7c91c9570ac9b69291f6e876)

But it sure is unloading on her, right in the face. Fuck me, this is a nasty chart. You can tinker around with that downward channel all you like and it's never gonna look like anything other than you losing more money.  The $180 mark is your beacon of hope, because after that I don't see all that much in the way of a slide all the way to $130.

&#x200B;

Let's take a look at the daily chart, just for fun:

[Yep, still looks bad](https://preview.redd.it/qzs8yizwmte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cd95571285e835337935af6a7c79857a0f984c)

You see, by making this chart that doesn't show anything under $170, that means the price ***cannot go under $170***. This is because charts are magic spells that you cast on the ticker. Try it out next time you're losing all your money!

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 6. Romancing the Wood**

Looking at her recent under performance, one must inevitably ask: Has Cathie Wood lost her touch? Or perhaps: Was it nothing but luck all along? There's no easy answer here.

Without a doubt a cult of personality has risen up around Cathie and that has helped her outperform, as hordes of retail investors decided to buy into whatever she was buying into. Indeed, ***this very processes*** appears to be part of her strategy: i.e., she buys a new, 'innovative' company, goes on CNBC to talk about, then all the youtubers make videos about it and the subs dedicated to her start talking about it, and boom, just like that she sent the ticker to the moon.

Despite this, I don't think she just some charlatan. Some of her choices are questionable, certainly, but others indicate to me that she is doing exactly what she claims: investing in the companies of tomorrow. It is simply that she, like any human being, can be wrong. And sometimes, *horribly wrong*.

I'm not going to make a snide comment about how she came to her idea for these types of investment funds. The younger version of Cbass wore that cloak of sneering superiority, and doffing it was one of the better character choices I've ever made. Perhaps the only good one. People like to snicker when someone describes their epiphany in religious terms, forgetting that every human until these most recent times did exactly that whenever an idea came to them.  I'll say no more.

As for whether her idea will work out for her, that has yet to be decided. As I've seen others here note, she appears to be trying to play catch-up, afraid that her recent slips will trigger a rush to the gates causing the collapse of her whole endeavor. This is a real danger for her, but doubling down like a degenerate gambler at 5:00 am in the casino is probably the wrong call. To that point, I'm actually happy to see her selling, even for a loss. For a while there, it looked like she was going to just keep buying into failing positions, hoping her very act of buying would be the thing that re-ignited the play.

Now, our old buddy Jim Cramer sure does like to talk about Mrs. Wood. Some have called him all sorts of names for his seeming obsession with her, but I rather think he saw what she was doing with her purchase-and-pump routine and it *irked* him. This is his game, too, but in Cramer's mind he only pumps 'responsible' plays, while Cathie is pumping crap.

Or maybe Jim was just trying to Romance the Wood:

[Good luck Jim!](https://preview.redd.it/qsap2lax0ue71.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be0e0cbfd1ee6ceaba5ded01887a1229f07df2bb)

"$BB Stock Price - 15-20% downside, 50%+ upside potential in 2-4 weeks."," Greetings everyone, been a while. Hope everyone has enjoyed their summer more than I have, working two jobs right now so I can buy more shares of $BB. Let's get down to business.

Daily chart (USD)

https://preview.redd.it/6aq8deev6te71.png?width=1546&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fb459dcfda538427e6e9a004b1867fccbbd13d5

Currently about to reach a triple bottom in the $9.80 USD range. This line of support has long been used even before the reddit rally late January, going as far back as 2013. A triple bottom can act as a strong foundation to the upside.  
That being said, it is possible we see the $8.30 range. This is the current possible \~15-20% downside of the current price and in my eyes, the absolute bottom.

Why is it the bottom?

https://preview.redd.it/ynu7bjwv6te71.png?width=1268&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6431fb325987ac23175d9c0ed6a4e88f5ce8cba

&#x200B;

This is the positions cost distribution of $BB taken from WeBulls. Its not a perfect measure, but it allows us to see where the majority of people are positioned right now. If people are holding the bag at \~15.00, than at this point they may as well keep holding.

Triple bottom - Strong sign of support in the $9.80 area. Selling pressure has dropped. Getting close to breaking that downward channel. If $9.80 holds over the next few days that means that a longer bull trend has formed by producing ""higher-lows"".

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x9tuboiw6te71.png?width=1550&format=png&auto=webp&s=51c96cab37a31dace3053cb12f0c5deafb0c73a2

This is a weekly chart, its looking like we are forming a wedge. RSI remains healthy on the weekly. Bollinger bands are also looking flat/even.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6yd1das17te71.png?width=1543&format=png&auto=webp&s=72bf03c75c920547eb22c32752d57fccc68932e2

(Daily) Bollinger bands are starting to move horizontally on the bottom band, showing that we may finally be breaking out of this downward channel and may continue to stay in the $9.80 range.  
RSI looking low-ish but moderately healthy.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m2bbg9q47te71.png?width=1548&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd8a85de0a33fc3fb2fc575199325adb42d2486b

The 4-hour chart shows $BB bollinger bands are horizontal, meaning the price has stabilized. Another reason why I believe we may currently be at the bottom and ready for the next run up.

Saw a rejection of the uptrend on Wednesday, perfectly played into the channel. We should be seeing another test of breaking the channel this week.

Volume is drying up, although after Wednesday's pop a lot of purchasing in the $10 range is a good sign. Anything under $10 is a buy imo.

What I would like to see is on more test at $9.80 and bounce up possibly on Wednesday or Thursday, and continue to run flat for the rest of the week. This would show strength and is an absolute buy.

If $9.80 does not fall and we do not test the $8.30 range, this will be an overall bull-case for $BB and we are likely to never see $BB in the single digits ever again after the next run up.

If $9.80 does fall into the $8.30 range, well congratulations, you have a buy there too. Anything under $10 is a screaming buy for $BB with its current news dependent situation.

Where do I believe that we'll run up to?  
When BB breaks out in the next two weeks, it should be around a 50%+ pop over a course of a few days. As in my previous posts, $14.50 is the heaviest line of significance/line of resistance. It also coincides with where most of the bag holders are funny enough, so there will be strong selling pressure for some to get their money back.  
$14.50 is also roughly where my wedge lands over the next few weeks.  
If $14.50 is blown past then we are out of the trend and its up to the market to decide where it goes.

Overall, I believe that in the current prices that there is a maximum 20% downside, and at worst \~50% upside over the course of the next two to three weeks. A great play for traders or those of you that want to/need to average down.

DYODD. I'm not a financial investor.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WFvWUJb_E02c7xBqPN92uxmvUjvKC4noNDRJLXGNfUo/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Wednesday AH has a load favorable trades.** $ROKU, $FSLY, $ETSY, $LMND, $BNGO all have an average move of over 10%, and are all set to report on Wednesday. If you’re looking to gamble, I would personally roll the dice on one of these companies since they have the highest likelihood of providing us with a profitable moonshot which will greatly offset the IV crush we’ll experience. Since they’re reporting Wednesday after hours, the options for them will be *incredibly cheap* because they will only have one day left before they expire, and theta will have made them close to worthless. **Cheap options, huge potential moves.** What’s there not to love? The best part is, many of these options are priced inefficiently. At the time of writing, $ROKU has a projected move of 8% but often moves double that. The same goes for $FSLY. These ratios will only get better for us throughout the week as theta does its thing. I’ll likely throw on a couple of straddles right before close on Wednesday.

&nbsp;

- **$LYFT and $UBER provide us with a collateral play opportunity.**  Pretty straightforward play this time around - if you’re bullish or bearish on either company, you should look to enter an $UBER position BEFORE $LYFT reports earnings on Tuesday. The $LFYT report will likely move both $LYFT and $UBER equally. If we play $LYFT, we run the risk of getting IV crushed, or having a move go against us. If we play $UBER, we’ll reap the rewards if we are right, while also avoiding IV crush. Furthermore, if the move goes against us, IV will inflate, offsetting any potential losses we may experience. **You could also look to do the same with $PENN and $DKNG.** This was just a crude summary, if you wish to learn more about this type of trade, check out my writeup on collateral plays [**here.**](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

&nbsp;

- **Avoid $BABA and $NKLA like the plague.** Both companies are getting hammered due to outside circumstances, meaning that earnings will have very little to no impact on their overall stock prices. $BABA is getting smacked around by the Chinese government, and $NKLA is facing round 8 or 9 of fraud charges. I have no stake in either company, nor do I ever plan to, but I know some idiots will inevitably try buying the dip thinking they’re Warren Buffet. Do not play $NKLA or $BABA this week.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I haven’t had much time to review any extra trades given that I’ve been extremely busy this weekend. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

#Summary and Conclusion

We’ve got a wild week ahead! Lots of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap companies across many different sectors are set to report, meaning we’ve got some huge opportunities to generate some serious alpha. If you see any appealing plays I’ve missed, feel free to let me know!

"What is the Fed up to?!? Breaking down Positions, Transactions, and Debt Monetization","This article first appeared on SchiffGold.

# Introduction

The Federal Reserve has three primary tools to conduct Monetary Policy: reserve requirements, the discount rate, and open market operations (Quantitative Easing). Open market operations is how the Fed uses its balance sheet to provide liquidity to the market. More details can be found [here](https://www.federalreserveeducation.org/about-the-fed/structure-and-functions/monetary-policy). The Fed defines Open Market Operations as:

*Open market operations involve the buying and selling of government securities. The term “open market” means that the Fed doesn’t decide on its own which securities dealers it will do business with on a particular day. Rather, the choice emerges from an “open market” in which the various securities dealers that the Fed does business with – the primary dealers – compete on the basis of price. Open market operations are flexible, and thus, the most frequently used tool of monetary policy.*

This is a fancy way of saying the Fed prints money to buy up US debt, providing liquidity while also keeping interest rates low. Essentially, Quantitative Easing (QE) is debt monetization. This analysis explores the changes in the Fed balance sheet to better understand what the Fed is buying and when.

# Recent Trends

The latest balance sheet figures show the total at 8.22T, up 143B from the prior month end, but down in the past week by 19B. The chart below shows how the Fed Balance sheet has grown by instrument over the last 18 months. The major surge from COVID can be clearly seen as 2.5T was added within 2 months. The monthly changes since reflect QE on autopilot. Autopilot targets about 120B in monthly purchases split by 40B in MBS and 80B in US Treasuries. As the numbers show, this is not exact, but an approximation.

The “Other” category surged and fell last year due to Repurchase Agreements. This is the opposite of the Reverse Repos. In standard Repo Agreements, the Fed buys from a dealer with an agreement to return the security. This was designed to be temporary in nature rather than a permanent add to the balance sheet. These repurchase agreements put a floor under the treasury market by providing unlimited liquidity.

&#x200B;

[ Figure 1: Monthly Change by Instrument](https://preview.redd.it/zp68y9e3hre71.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa23213feb8b065b37a1f6f6a65a5f5347ba062b)

 

The table below shows the breakdown of holdings by instrument and the period over period change as indicated. The main takeaways:

* The balance sheet has grown by 1.27B over the last year, averaging about 100B a month rather than the target of 120B
   * More recent months are trending above this average and target
* The balance sheet grew by $4T over 3 years, the majority of which occurred since the start of Covid
* In the latest month, the focus has been on MBS(65B) and Shorter term treasuries of 1-5 years (39B)
* The Fed is not putting much emphasis on short term debt adding only 63B over 1 year
   * The market for short term treasuries is still very liquid and does not need Fed support
   * Almost 40% of the Treasury Balance sits in 1-5 year maturing debt with another 40% in 5+
* MBS has grown by 451B over the last year and Treasuries have grown almost 1T

&#x200B;

[ Figure 2: Balance Sheet Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/r3znppy6hre71.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=174ba50f36137b1b082eee218dfffb6996cb84d5)

 The chart below shows the percent distribution by product. While absolute values have increased quite significantly as shown in the table above, the distribution of holdings has changed some. MBS made up 40% of the balance sheet 3 years ago, but the number has fallen to under 30% as short term (<1 year) and medium term (5-10 years) has increased from 9% to 12.6% and 7% to 11.7% respectively. 

&#x200B;

#  ZOOMING INTO WEEKLY

Another chart to look at is the weekly change in the balance sheet. Anyone who follows the balance sheet closely, will notice it dips once a month before jumping back up. The chart below shows how the fed balance sheet changes week over week. As seen, there are a few consistent trends:

* A series of MBS Mature about every four weeks  

   * This results in a slight decrease in the balance sheet for that week
* A bulk of MBS is also bought every 4 weeks that is larger then the maturing MBS  

   * This creates a surge in the balance sheet for that week
* Treasury securities mature and are purchased with less volatility

The latest week saw 37B in MBS mature with 20B in Treasuries purchased. It is likely that in 2 weeks there will be a large purchase of MBS.

&#x200B;

[ Figure 4: Fed Balance Sheet Weekly Changes](https://preview.redd.it/flk0r8unhre71.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=b069f717549fa962b2f8fa8dfbb5c10f007efbb0)

 

The table below shows how the latest week compares to the weekly averages over 4, 24, 52, and 156 (3 years) weeks. The weekly averages are shown to gauge whether the current periods (1 and 4 weeks) are accelerating or decelerating. The averages are all divisible by 4 because that is about how many weeks a full cycle takes as shown in the plot above.

The Fed has averaged about 35B per week for 4 weeks totaling 140B, which is slightly above the 120B monthly target. The latest week saw a more than 50% increase in debt maturing in 1-5 years compared to the 4, 24, and 52 week averages. Perhaps this helped drive the 2-year rate from 25bps back to 20bps over the last two weeks.

&#x200B;

#  Historical Perspective

As mentioned, the Fed is monetizing US Debt. The chart below uses the data from the [debt analysis](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/us-debt-analysis-june-2021/) and matches it up with the Fed balance sheet holdings. While this is not a perfect one to one match due to the nature of reporting, the outcome can be seen below. This chart focuses specifically on Treasury securities: Bills (<1 Year maturity), Notes (1-10 year), and Bonds (10+ years). This is the bulk of debt issuance and Fed purchases.

As can be seen below the Fed has monetized a large percentage of debt issued since Jan 2020. The focus is clearly seen in Notes and Bonds to keep a lid on long term rates. The first chart shows the debt added in each of the last 4 years by instrument. The bottom chart shows the percent of that debt the Fed has purchased. In 2020, the Fed monetized more than 100% of notes and 90% of bonds. In 2021 those numbers have fallen to 35% and 46% respectively. While not a complete monetization, this is still **massive** in terms of scope.

&#x200B;

[ Figure 6: Debt Issuance by Year and Instrument](https://preview.redd.it/hj4zoscvhre71.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=00c710a6d27ca45568c6c9295e352624a2260281)

&#x200B;

[ Figure 7: Fed Purchase &#37; of Debt Issuance](https://preview.redd.it/8rghj3kyhre71.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=7de6ef3e7f79b055014ba69a0278dcd2b0dc8b00)

 

The final plot below takes a larger view of the balance sheet. It is clear to see how the usage of the balance sheet has changed since the Global Financial Crisis. The tapering from 2017-2019 can be seen in the slight dip before the massive surge due to Covid.

There is no way the Fed will come close to shrinking the balance sheet at this stage. With more Fiscal spending on the horizon and an economy addicted to low interest rates, it is probable that the growth of the balance sheet may accelerate rather than decelerate.

&#x200B;

# What it means for Gold and Silver

The Fed balance sheet is one of the drivers to the [expanding Money Supply](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/money-supply-july-2021-growth-rate-sees-massive-drop/). The Fed monetary tools are used to keep rates low and cheap credit flowing. If the Fed keeps up the monetary stimulus, it will continue to drive inflation higher. If the Fed were to ever try and taper, allowing longer term rates to rise, it will put pressure on many areas of the economy, including the [Federal Deficit](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/us-budget-deficit-analysis-june-2021/). In either case, Gold and Silver should benefit from high inflation if the Fed keeps printing or a shrinking economy if the Fed tapers.",,0,-0.4857
Callaway will smash earnings on 8/5. YOLO 35C 8/20,"# $ELY

Earnings for Callaway are expected on 8/5. I've put every free dollar into 35C for 8/20.

https://preview.redd.it/ekc2s54dere71.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffd30bd03206a3a5578a1bb3f350e821f845aa88

Callaway is no longer just a golf company. They've expanded into multiple verticals:

1. Golf equipment (Callaway, OGIO)
2. Apparel (Jack Wolfskin, Travis Matthew)
3. TopGolf

Why did I buy? Because golf is on a rebound. Last quarter, the golf equipment business and apparel alone pulled in an [EPS of 0.62](https://ir.callawaygolf.com/static-files/baf65de9-363e-4bef-b11b-d965df2555e0); this was during peak COVID. Equipment sales are up:

>The surge in equipment sales that began last May is showing no signs of letting up. Through June, YTD combined golf club and ball wholesale dollar sales are up 77% over last year and 35% over 2019.

[source: National Golf Foundation](https://www.thengfq.com/2021/07/equipment-sales-continue-run/)

This quarter, I expect the sales in the golf and apparel segments will be robust, along with additional revenue from [TopGolf](https://topgolf.com/us/).

TopGolf is a gamified driving range mixed with a restaurant. They print money. It's like $100 to rent a bay and the whole time you can order food and drinks. Imagine if you had to pay to rent a table at a restaurant. [Others have done DD showing how packed they always are](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdsx3i/ely_dd_i_tried_making_an_online_reservation_at_60/). People even beg on Twitter to have TopGolf come to their city. I personally love TopGolf.

They're opening new venues at a breakneck pace. [TopGolf just opened a new venue in NYC this weekend](https://www.newsday.com/lifestyle/recreation/topgolf-long-island-1.50320672). This year, they plan to open 8 new venues for a total of 69 while last year they had 61:

>Globally, we have 66 company-owned venues in operation. For the full year, we are on track to open at least three more venues, for a total of at least eight venues this year. We also remain confident in our pipeline for future venues.

[source: Q1 2021 earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/callaway-golf-ely-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

TopGolf originally was supposed to IPO on their own, valued at 4B, until the pandemic hit. TopGolf instead chose to sell the business to Callaway at a 2.5B valuation. **Currently, Callaway in total is valued at \~5.9B.** In a post-pandemic world, new golfers from the lockdown, new golfers from TopGolf, and a booming sportswear business [(which Nike proved is strong)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/24/nike-nke-q4-2021-earnings.html), I don't see how this valuation makes sense. Additionally, [TopTracer](https://topgolf.com/us/toptracer/) being sold to driving ranges across the world:

>We successfully installed 1,533 bays in Q1, a new record despite the COVID challenges globally. We now have just over 10,000 bays globally, which is significantly more than our largest competitor. Demand remains strong for the product, and we are finding strong synergies between the Callaway sales team and the Toptracer team. We remain on track for 8,000 bays this year.

It seems every business segment will either meet or exceed expectations. Yet for some reason, analysts are stuck in the past- their thesis is that ""young people don't like golf."" What? My friends that don't play golf are always down to hit TopGolf, crush a few brews, and hang out. It's for hardcore/casual golfers alike.

This quarter, TopGolf will be fully included in earnings. [The average EPS estimate for this quarter is 0.01](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ELY/analysis/) which I think completely ignores these facts. I also expect that the COVID shock from last year will have fully recovered. So now, Callaway has a bigger market from all the COVID golfers to sell golf shit, a sportswear business, and a money machine ala TopGolf. Callaway has been diversifying into a behemoth.

China Doesn’t Care About US Investor’s Money,"I see quite a few posts on China this morning and want to clarify a few points. In full disclosure I lost over 300k on Chinese stocks in a combination of shares, warrants, and options. Yes, I am glad I sold because my losses would be even greater. 

1. Chinese entrepreneurs like to IPO in America because the entrepreneurs and VCs are given US dollars for their shares. For those that didn’t know it is almost impossible to move money out of China. This is true for American companies such as Apple and Starbucks, the money stays there. It is a closed capital account. IPOs in American markets means foreign investors (American investors) can get liquidity when investing in a Chinese company. 

2. The CCP was more than happy to allow American IPOs because they need US dollars. The world does not trust the Renminbi and it is only used in 1 percent of transactions compared to 60 percent for the US dollar. China must use US dollars to trade with the world. (If anyone is familiar with the Belt and Road you will know China uses dollars to fund such project). When Chinese investors and entrepreneurs are allowed to sell their shares in American markets they bring in US dollars. 

3. China has global ambitions of being a super power. After watching a certain guy (not trying to get political) get banned from social media and made irrelevant, Xi and the CCP woke up to the reality it could be next. The party then decided to crack down even further on its entrepreneurs, who the CCP believes may one day oppose it. The crack down on the Ant IPO was just the start. (For those who don’t know, China does not take criticism well. If Apple/Tesla was to criticize the CCP both businesses would fail to operate in China (this happened to Hilton for naming Taiwan as a country, but only for a week).This is why you see NO American CEOs or entrepreneurs criticize China. 

4. The SEC is finally acting. News has broke the SEC will not allow anymore Chinese IPOs without disclosure of the CCP’s control. Every company in China is subject to control by the CCP. You either comply or you are sent to a camp. You also have the threat of delisting because of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. 

At this point China has pissed off pretty much the entire US. From crashing internet money, to stocks, and don’t forget about their lies about COVID. I can’t imagine investors will bid up the price of these stocks again. Cut your loses and consider this market dead. Xi is a 1940s German leader reincarnated.",,0,0.4939
Delta Variant and What It Means,"Okay, listen up autists. It’s time for everyone to take a seat, and think about what the Delta Variant *actually* means to us. 

First off, this variant is ultra contagious. Without immunity or vaccination it is almost a certainty, you will get it. That is a *good* thing. 

This variant isn’t killing people in large numbers, or causing more severe disease. What is it doing? Giving you immunity! This is the solution to our problem. This will grant us herd immunity!

What's really going on with inflation?,"In June 2021 inflation increased **5.4%** compared to June 2020 ([official release](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm)).

&#x200B;

If we look at who were the main contributors of inflation, we see that *Used Cars & Trucks* increased **10%** from March to April, **7.3%** from April to May and **10.5%** from May to June. The weight of *Used Cars & Trucks* in the CPI is 3.166% (see Relative Importance column [here](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t02.htm)), which means that in the last three months, **0.96%** of the CPI increase was due to an increase in prices of *Used Cars & Trucks*.

&#x200B;

The issue seems to be the global semiconductor shortage, that is slowing the production of Cars in the US and worldwide (for example: [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-16/record-used-car-prices-can-t-keep-buyers-away)). I'm however wondering if this is true (or fully true). If we look at the price increase for new cars, we can see that the price increase is ""just"" 5.3% compared to last year. Why would used cars prices increase 45% in one year while the new cars prices increased just by 5.3%? If there is a global shortage, shouldn't the prices of new cars also skyrocket?

[\(The first column is the weight in CPI, the second column is the YoY price change\)](https://preview.redd.it/hvkpfvznvqe71.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&s=080f3e70cbe2109e47b0eb14fd703204be09cd8f)

I also checked the how prices of electronic devices (such as smartphones, PCs, etc.) changed in the last year. In the image below you can see their prices deceased by 17.8%. So if there is a global shortage of chips that slowed down the production of cars and therefore increased the price of used cars, why price of electronic devices didn't increase accordingly?

[\(The first column is the weight in CPI, the second column is the YoY price change\)](https://preview.redd.it/h5gkptzrvqe71.png?width=818&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ce4268562d01db3fe0d270a7a62c29ef5e58fcc)

Finally, if we look at how the cost of renting cars and trucks increased over the last year, we see it increased by a whopping 87.7%, of which 45% just in the last 3 months.

[\(The first column is the weight in CPI, the second column is the YoY price change\)](https://preview.redd.it/dy59zcnuvqe71.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad878d60d821705920a83cf078bd476084d2fc41)

So my theory is that partially the increase is due to the semiconductor shortage, but most of the recent increase in used and cars prices, is the fact that due to re-opening economy people are traveling more and therefore renting more cars. As [this article](https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/europe-car-rental-carmageddon-cmd/index.html) mentions:

&#x200B;

*""Essentially, car hire companies tend to order their fleets about two or three months in advance, at the start of the year -- and, having been stung with the low demand last year, they hedged their bets this year.*

*In fact, Sixt confirmed to CNN that its latest figures show that for Q1 of 2021, it had 93,200 cars across its global network. That compares to 130,900 in Q1 of 2020, and 129,200 for the same period in 2019. That's a 29% decrease in vehicles, year on year.""*

&#x200B;

If you look at how the increases in car prices happened, the increase is mostly happened in the last 3 months, with the coming of summer, while before the increases were minimal, while the global semiconductor shortage was well known already in Q4-2020. So should we expect this increase in Used Cars & Trucks to vanish by the end of the summer?

&#x200B;

China is playing the long-game; US is running on band-aids,"China is not trying to kill their big tech, they are trying to make their business models more long-lived and sustainable both financially and socially.

It is definitely trying hard to create a more conservative financial system while contributing to a more equal distribution of wealth. Say what you want, but that ain't bad news at all if you're a long term investor.

China wants to rely less on foreign fund flows because they see high speculation and bubble activity in Western countries and they don't want their domestic companies to be exposed to that euphoria and collapse risk. It's easy for a company to act recklessly in such an environment, and these reckless acts might ruin the Government's efforts towards a stable and healthy growing market.

Remember, China is a country lead by a collectivist mindset where the good of the mass is more important than the good of a single company or individual (which will frequently lead to abuse of the few for the many, in direct opposition to the policy of the US government which easily sacrifices the many for the few on top (not so much Western Europe). In the end the collective good turns out to be the company's best interest too.

They are not oblivious to the effects these measures have on the markets, even going as far as to post ads on the front page of every newspaper claiming that they are not in any way trying to harm tech companies, but actually helping them become more sustainable and resilient.

&#x200B;

Was the crackdown on education stocks really a surprise?

In April the government released a document analyzing the education system of the country and already pointing out the problems they saw and possible corrective measures.

If somebody read those (and they should have if they owned the companies) they could have anticipated the sector to be caught in the regulation crossfire. But people don't do their due diligence and always act surprised when things go south. China is always clear about its intentions, we're just unable to understand them because we keep thinking in Western terms and taking our society and the companies we know as the ""default"" condition, which is fundamentally wrong.

Was the crackdown on Didi a surprise too?

Absolutely not. The government had explicitly recommended Didi delayed their IPO until certain data issues had been dealt with. Their main concern was making sure data breaches were avoided since, well, the US is literally their main competitor.

Didi ignored all this and went ahead. What followed was more than expected.

&#x200B;

I'm not pretending their totalitarian government that seeks to have absolute control over everything and every piece of information and conducts ethnic cleansing is in any way the most advanced form of human governance.

I'm simply pointing out that it is doing what it is doing because it wants to secure a strong and steady growth for its companies, and it knows that can only be achieved if it does not come at the expense of impoverishing its population and compromising healthy competition and fair-play in all sectors.

Only the western investor deeply embroiled in never-ending ATH's and euphoria can view the sustainable long-term measures as unsustainable and the unsustainable short-term bandaids as sustainable.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Now this is what I call a controversial fucking post. I guess time will tell.

The casino doesn't care about your stupid borders and your Murica koolaid, and neither do I.

QS Management Team is so confident on their final success,"Quote from the latest earnings call:

 **John Saager**

The remainder of these questions are from the Say app. Sales of stock by key team members are being perceived by some as extreme with one shareholder claiming that our CTO, Tim Holme, sold 50% of his holdings. Noting that our Chief Legal Officer sold shares and our Chief Development Officer sold two-third of his shares. So the question becomes, is there anything to read into those share sales? And can you comment on the size of the share sale?

**Kevin Hettrich**

John, first, the percent of sale references in the questions are not accurate to correct the record here. As of the end of the quarter, Tim, our Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer, holds 96% of its prior holdings; as of June 30, 2021, Mohit Singh, our Chief Development Officer, holds 86%; and Mike McCarthy, our Chief Legal Officer holds 83%.

after merger, they recently reported 52m in weed sales which accounted for 100% apha and 4wks worth of tlry. which meant they were flat in sales qoq. these are like tier 3 mso numbers. 

on top of which, they're carrying about 3b in good will (most of it came from tlry) and 250m of weed inventory.  at their sales rate, it would take them over 2yrs to sell that. more than likely they would need to write down a signifcant portion of that inventory at some point. 

and they're valued at 7b. 

now they're looking to dilute further for some red herring that looks like mso acquisition but still smells like herring. truth is 1) they need to continue to acquire to grow rev to (hopefully, but doubtful)  justify their valuation since they can't sell weed (remember flat qoq growth and ballooning inventory) 2) they can't afford a tier 1 or 2 mso. 

institutional investors only hold about 10% of their float which is among the lowest of their peers. hell even aurora is 18% (which, in itself, is lunacy). canopy is about 25%. village farms near 40%. 10% are mso numbers and msos trade on the OTC where most funds can't invest!

skip the company pr, look at the official fins, check out their valuation, compare their numbers to any mso, and you'll come to the same conclusions. 

oh, and the current ceo makes outlandish money https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/ouspzi/-/h762qcd.  note that the old tlry ceo Brendan Kennedy continues to dump his shares faster than you can say weedstocks. the guy is no dummy https://wallmine.com/people/64826/brendan-kennedy

the only upside is that they're heavily shorted so can run up wildly like we saw with their recent er. but once people digested their fins (which were released after hours when their headline numbers were released premarket lol), looks like reality is setting in.

Once In A Lifetime Opportunity For Tech Stocks,"Just heard from friends in China there are over 200 cases in Nanjing, the capital city of Jiangsu. Regional lockdowns are happening. Florida just had over 20K cases in a day, the worst day since the pandemic started. 

Covid is far from over and we probably will go through another circle of rotating into tech and then rotating into “recovery” plays. 

As long as the covid is not over, JPOW is unlikely to taper. And the longer this pandemic stretches, the more the world will adopt technologies. And more will move from offline to online. Calls on AAPL for all kinds of electrical devices. 

After more people adopt technologies, more companies will upgrade their tech stacks to meet the new service traffic and reliability demand. Calls on tech cloud and infrastructure companies like AMZN. 

And once the world adopts technologies, it won’t be able to leave and tech just have that sticky magic. 

TLDR: Tech gonna moon and it just started. Covid is terrible for public health but it accelerated tech adoption by at least 10 years.",,5,0.4215
Call debit spreads,"I have seen a lot of loss porn on here, I wondered if anyone is using call debit spreads before yoloing their life savings on here... it seems like a solid strategy, if not can you run me through the reasons against not using this strategy? Honestly I came to be more aware of what options are through this subreddit and I don't really follow these methods but I do appreciate the desire to learn more that was sparked by this community. Anyway, im not any kind of expert but I hadn't heard this method mentioned much here.

For anyone who's unfamiliar, just the basic idea of buying a call and then selling a call roughly an additional $40 or $50 out of the money away from strike price to lower the break even price.",,0,0.0
There is a risk I'm overlooking and I'm asking for your help to find it. I think I found free money and don't want to be the next 1r0nyman.,"I've traded options for a couple years, mostly using theta decay strategies (the wheel, sometimes OTM spreads) and rarely buying far OTM calls and puts as lottery ticket plays. I've never done much with ITM options outside of buying them for leverage using LEAPS.

Here's my thesis:

I want to make an outsized bet that there will be some black swan event soon that could send the market toppling, or that inflation will start to get out of control fast and JPOW will do a 180 and go Paul Vlocker on this party and brutally murder the bull.

In the event of raising interest rates or a sudden and severe downturn, I suspect zombie companies will start to blow up left and right. The HYG ETF is comprised of junk bonds, many of which are companies I would consider teetering, especially if we have a rapid onset recession or rapid interest rate increases.

I was looking into selling ITM call credit spreads as a way to short the fund, with limited loss potential and without having to payout the dividend, pay borrow fees, or margin interest like I would if I was directly short.

Looking at specifically selling the $70c and buying the $88c for as close to $18 a spread as I can get. Experation can be variable but I'm looking for in the next 6 months.

Let's say I'm able to sell this spread for $17.95 and I sell 1000 of them. That's $1,795,000 in premium collected. If HYG collapses below $70c before expiration most of the intrinsic value will evaporate and I can close anywhere between break even and a $ million + payday. If I'm wrong I lose $0.05 ($5 per contract) per spread plus commission costs. ($5000 + $1300). So for a max loss of $6300 I could potentially make up to $1.7 million by shorting junk bonds when everyone is uncertain of the future.

The only risk I see is if I get assigned early, I'll have to exercise my long leg early to cover the short created on my assigned short call. Even in this case I only lose $5 per contract that gets assigned early on me.

The other ""risk"" I see is there's no way I can get filled that close to the risk free rate. ($18 a spread between $70c and $88c) maybe I'll have to adjust to $17.90 in which case max loss is $11,300. Or $17.85 where max loss is $16300.

So long as I can get reasonably close it seems like an absolute insane payout for just taking on early assignment risk.

What am I missing?

Am I really that likely to get assigned early on my short $70c leg?

Any input would be greatly appreciated.",,10,0.5687
